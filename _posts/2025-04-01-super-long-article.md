The moon had decided, quite without warning, to wear striped pajamas and hum show tunes while dangling over the rooftops. Naturally, the lampposts applauded, though one particularly jealous traffic light sulked by flashing green-red-green until it fainted from sheer dramatic flair. A pigeon wearing spectacles took careful notes, insisting this was the fourth such celestial performance this week, and soon the newspapers would run out of adjectives.

Down below, the cobblestones were restless; they shuffled about in patterns that only made sense if you squinted sideways and hummed the alphabet backward. A teapot, wobbling across the square on dainty porcelain feet, proclaimed that time had been canceled indefinitely, and anyone caught using minutes would be fined three giggles and a sneeze. No one objected, except for a man who had misplaced his shadow, though to be fair, the shadow was seen holidaying on the horizon, sipping a very smug-looking cappuccino.

As dawn tiptoed into the city wearing mismatched socks, the buildings began to stretch, yawn, and trade gossip about the weather on Jupiter. A bakery was overheard bragging about its new line of invisible muffins, guaranteed to taste like your fondest forgotten memory. Customers lined up around the block, each one pretending they hadn’t just eaten air and called it delicious.

Meanwhile, a choir of umbrellas practiced their harmonies in the drizzle, though their conductor — a stern rubber duck — kept quacking them off-key on purpose. Somewhere in the middle of it all, a child chased a balloon that wasn’t there, while a clock chimed thirteen o’clock and everyone clapped politely, unsure whether to continue existing or just applaud forever. The pigeon with spectacles sighed, folded its notes neatly, and declared: “This, undoubtedly, will be remembered as the most sensible day in history.”
